<h1 align="center" id="title">Advance Warning System for Railway Track Workers</h1>

<p id="description">The Advance Warning System for Railway Track Workers is designed to enhance safety by providing timely alerts to workers on the railway tracks about approaching locomotives. This system aims to prevent accidents and fatalities by alerting railway staff in advance especially in adverse conditions such as inclement weather or multiple track lines.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- Incentive of The Model: The model / device is designed to give an alert to the railway workers working on track. Since in the past 5 years 361 innocent railway staffs have died on the track due to the approaching trains. This fatal accident caused us to wary over the rail staff‚Äôs working on the tracks. Our prototype is inspired by the ignited hope for the hard working staff‚Äôs safety. The motive of the device is to generate an alarm so that the working staff are alerted about the approaching train and they move away from that particular track for the time being till the train crosses that track.
- Approach: An ESP 8266 module is used which will be installed in the locomotive of the train. This ESP 8266 module will act as a Wi-Fi hotspot. An ESP 32 module will act as a Wi-Fi device and it is interfaced with a buzzer and it will be given to the workers working on the railway tracks. When an approaching train is about 1 km away from the area where the railway staffs are working the ESP 32 module will detect only the Wi-Fi hotspot i.e. ESP 8266 module that was already installed in the locomotive. A ‚Äòbeep‚Äô sound will be generated by the buzzer and the sound will get more amplified as the train approach near the working area. After the train slowly passes away the construction site the intensity of the buzzer gets decreased and when the train has completely passed away from working site there will be no sound of the buzzer. For the multiple tracks a device containing motion sensor will be used and this device is portable. The railway workers have to place this device beside the track on which they are working at a distance of 500m away from an approaching train. This device will sense the motion of the approaching train in that track. This would turn on the Wi-Fi hotspot (ESP 8266) and the Wi-Fi receiver present with the workers will detect the Wi-Fi of the locomotive and the buzzer will turn ON.
